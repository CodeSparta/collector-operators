## Limited Support Lifecycle
```
This collector plugin is built for limited lifespan AirGap OLM Enablement on OCP 4.5.x

The OCP Roadmap for 4.6+ releases will significantly change manifest
distribution and image name:tag relelease controls. Due to this significant
expected design change current code work is for short term enablement only.
Enhancements, code cleanup, and re-useability efforts will be minimum to
function only until new golang based 4.6 artifact rake utils are viable to
replace the python scripts.
